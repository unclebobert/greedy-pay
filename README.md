# Setup (Local)
1. Install node 22.2 with nvm
2. Run `npm i` in the `frontend` directory
3. If there are typing errors w/ routes, try running `npm run dev` once to generate the scaffolding necessary for routes
    - The [routing library](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) I chose needs to generate a `routeTree.gen.ts`; it probably needs to do this everytime the routes change but starting the dev server does this automatically.
    - It also creates a `.tanstack` folder but that can be ignored (it is being ignored by git right now)
4. If there are any other typing errors, that means bad things have happened
5. Ignore the million config files in `frontend`
    - average node project

# Decisions
A [query library](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) is installed - this is supposed to make fetching data and state management easier but depending on how things look we might not need to deal with it and can just use `useEffect` hooks instead because its a lot of extra complexity

## Shadcn
- Go [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) and just copy any component you want to use
- Run the given command for the component i.e. `npx shadcn@latest add ...`
- The component code will appear in src/components/ui
  - If you want you can edit the components with tailwind classes
    - e.g. I have already changed the button to have a pointer cursor on hover

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
    ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
})
```
